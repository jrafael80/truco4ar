# Argentine Truco Rules

## Overview

Truco is a traditional Argentine card game played with a Spanish deck of 40 cards. It's a trick-taking game where bluffing and strategy are as important as the cards you hold. The game is typically played in teams of two, with partners sitting across from each other.

## The Deck

### Card Composition
- **Spanish deck**: 40 cards total
- **Excluded cards**: 8s, 9s, and 10s are not used
- **Suits**:
  - Espadas (Swords)
  - Bastos (Clubs)
  - Oros (Coins/Gold)
  - Copas (Cups)
- **Ranks**: 1 (Ace), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, Jack (10), Knight (11), King (12)

## Card Hierarchy for Truco

The cards have a specific ranking for determining trick winners (from highest to lowest):

### Special Cards (Highest)
1. **1 of Swords (Espada)** - "Ancho de Espadas" (Highest card)
2. **1 of Clubs (Bastos)** - "Ancho de Bastos"
3. **7 of Swords (Espada)**
4. **7 of Coins (Oros)** - "Siete de Oro"

### Regular Cards (by rank, not suit)
5. **3s** (all four suits are equal)
6. **2s** (all four suits are equal)
7. **1 of Coins (Oros)** and **1 of Cups (Copas)** (equal)
8. **Kings (12)** (all four suits are equal)
9. **Knights (11)** (all four suits are equal)
10. **Jacks (10)** (all four suits are equal)
11. **7 of Clubs (Bastos)** and **7 of Cups (Copas)** (equal)
12. **6s** (all four suits are equal)
13. **5s** (all four suits are equal)
14. **4s** (all four suits are equal) - Lowest cards

**Important**: When cards are equal in rank (except the special cards), the first one played wins the trick.

## Game Setup

### Players
- **4 players** in two teams (most common)
- **2 players** (one-on-one variant)
- **6 players** in two teams of three (less common)

### Teams
- Players 1 and 3 form one team
- Players 2 and 4 form the other team
- Partners sit across from each other

### Dealing
- Dealer rotates clockwise after each hand
- Each player receives **3 cards**
- Cards are dealt one at a time to each player
- Players may not look at their cards until all cards are dealt

### Starting Player
- The player to the right of the dealer plays first (counterclockwise rotation)

## Game Objective

The first team to reach **30 points** wins the game. Points can be won from three main sources:
1. **Truco** - The trick-taking component
2. **Envido** - Betting on card combinations
3. **Flor** - Special bet when holding three cards of the same suit (optional variant)

## Playing a Hand

A hand consists of up to three tricks (called "bazas"). Each trick involves:
1. Each player plays one card
2. The highest card wins the trick
3. The winner of the trick leads the next one

### Winning a Hand
- **Best of three tricks**: Win two tricks to win the hand
- **Parda** (tie): If a trick ends in a tie, it's called "parda"
- **Special cases**:
  - Win first trick + parda = win hand
  - Parda + win second trick = win hand
  - Parda + parda = first team to win a trick wins
  - Win one trick each + third is parda = first team to win wins

## Truco (The Bet)

"Truco" means "trick" or "bet." Players can raise the stakes of the hand through a series of challenges:

### The Progression
1. **Truco** (called by any player): Raises hand value to 2 points
   - Opponent can: **Accept** (play for 2), **Decline** (forfeit, 1 point to caller)

2. **Retruco** (called by opponent): Raises hand value to 3 points
   - Original caller can: **Accept** (play for 3), **Decline** (forfeit, 2 points to opponent)

3. **Vale Cuatro** (called by original caller): Raises hand value to 4 points
   - Opponent can: **Accept** (play for 4), **Decline** (forfeit, 3 points to caller)

### Truco Rules
- Can be called at any time before playing the last card of the hand
- Only affects the hand's point value, not Envido
- Once accepted, the hand continues with raised stakes
- If declined, the decliner forfeits and points are awarded immediately

### Communication with Partner
- Partners can signal to each other using facial expressions, hand signals, or verbal cues
- However, teams cannot discuss cards or strategy explicitly
- Traditional signals are part of the game's culture and strategy

## Envido

Envido is a side bet based on the sum of cards of the same suit in your hand. It's separate from Truco.

### Calculating Envido Score
- **Two cards of the same suit**: Add their face values + 20
  - Example: 7 of Swords + 6 of Swords = 33 (7 + 6 + 20)
- **Three cards of the same suit**: Take the two highest, add values + 20
  - Example: 7, 6, 4 of Swords = 33 (7 + 6 + 20, ignore the 4)
- **No cards of the same suit**: Your highest card's value
  - Face cards (J, K, Q) = 0 value for Envido
  - Example: King of Swords, 5 of Bastos, 3 of Oros = 5

### Card Values for Envido
- **1-7**: Face value (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)
- **Jack, Knight, King**: 0 value (but still count toward having cards of same suit)

### Envido Progression
1. **Envido** (2 points): First bet
   - Opponent can: **Accept**, **Decline** (1 point to caller), **Raise**

2. **Envido Envido** (4 points): Raise from Envido
   - Opponent can: **Accept**, **Decline** (2 points to caller), **Raise**

3. **Real Envido** (5 points): Can be called after Envido or Envido Envido
   - Opponent can: **Accept**, **Decline** (previous bet points to caller), **Raise to Falta Envido**

4. **Falta Envido** (highest bet): Points equal to what's needed to win the game
   - If team A needs 10 points to reach 30, and team B needs 15 points to reach 30
   - Falta Envido winner gets the minimum of the two (10 points in this case)
   - Opponent can: **Accept**, **Decline** (previous bet points to caller)

### Envido Rules
- Must be called before the first card is played
- If accepted, both teams reveal their Envido score
- Highest score wins the Envido points
- If scores tie, the team that didn't call Envido wins
- After Envido is resolved, the hand continues normally for Truco

### Combining Bets
- Players often call "Envido, Envido" or "Envido, Real Envido" in sequence
- The last bet in the sequence determines the stakes if accepted

## Flor (Optional Variant)

Flor occurs when a player has three cards of the same suit.

### Flor Rules
- **Flor** (3 points): Automatically called when a player has three cards of same suit
- Must be called before any other bet (even before Envido)
- All players with Flor must reveal it
- Highest Flor score wins

### Flor Score Calculation
- Sum of all three cards + 20
- Example: 7, 6, 4 of Swords = 37 (7 + 6 + 4 + 20)

### Flor Progression
- **Flor** (3 points)
- **Contraflor** (6 points) - Can be called if opponent also has Flor
- **Contraflor al Resto** - Like Falta Envido, stakes are what's needed to win

### Flor Rules
- If only one team has Flor, they win 3 points automatically
- If both teams have Flor, they can raise the bet
- Flor is resolved before Envido and Truco

## Scoring Summary

| Bet | Points (if accepted) | Points (if declined) |
|-----|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Truco Progression** | | |
| Truco | 2 | 1 |
| Retruco | 3 | 2 |
| Vale Cuatro | 4 | 3 |
| **Envido Progression** | | |
| Envido | 2 | 1 |
| Envido Envido | 4 | 2 |
| Real Envido | 5 | Previous bet value |
| Falta Envido | Points needed to win | Previous bet value |
| **Flor (Optional)** | | |
| Flor | 3 | N/A (automatic) |
| Contraflor | 6 | 3 |
| Contraflor al Resto | Points needed to win | 6 |

## Winning the Game

- First team to **30 points** wins
- If both teams would reach 30 in the same hand:
  - Flor beats Envido beats Truco
  - Order of calling breaks ties
  - Team that was behind goes first in counting

## Strategy Tips

### General Strategy
- **Bluffing is key**: Truco is as much about psychology as cards
- **Partner coordination**: Use signals to communicate confidence
- **Risk management**: Know when to decline and cut your losses
- **Card counting**: Track which high cards have been played

### Envido Strategy
- With 27+ points: Very strong, consider raising
- With 23-26 points: Good hand, call Envido
- Below 20: Consider declining if opponent calls
- Remember: Face cards are worth 0 for Envido

### Truco Strategy
- High cards (Anchos, 7s, 3s): Strong Truco hand
- Mix of medium cards: Risky, depends on opponent signals
- Low cards (4s, 5s, 6s): Usually decline unless bluffing
- First to play has disadvantage (others see your card)

## Special Situations

### Going to the Mazo (Deck)
- If all players fold without playing, the hand ends
- The team that declined loses points based on what was at stake
- New hand is dealt

### Mano (First Player Advantage)
- The player to dealer's right has "mano" (first to act)
- In case of ties, mano wins
- Mano has slight advantage in Envido/Flor decisions

### Son Buenas/Son Malas
- After raising a bet, players often ask "Son buenas?" (Are they good?)
- Asking to confirm if opponent accepts or declines
- Not mandatory, but part of traditional gameplay

## Common Terminology

- **Ancho**: The 1 of Swords or Clubs (high-value cards)
- **Baza/Truco**: A trick
- **Mano**: The first player to act
- **Parda**: A tied trick
- **Mazo**: The deck; also "going to the mazo" (folding)
- **Me voy al mazo**: "I fold"
- **Quiero**: "I accept" the bet
- **No quiero**: "I decline" the bet
- **Tanto**: "How much?" (asking opponent's Envido score)

## Variations

### Regional Differences
- Some regions play to 15 or 24 points instead of 30
- Flor rules vary by region (some don't use it at all)
- Some variants allow "Envido" to be called after first card is played
- Signal conventions differ by region and group

### Team Sizes
- **2-player**: More straightforward, no partner communication
- **4-player**: Standard, most strategic
- **6-player**: More chaotic, partners harder to coordinate
